# Crop-Prediction
Crop Prediction Model

Overview
This project is a crop prediction model that helps farmers determine the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate recommendations.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which contains:
Features: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
Target Variable: Crop type

Files in the Repository
- `crop_prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `Crop_recommendation.csv` - The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction.git
   cd crop-prediction
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Ensure `requirements.txt` is created with necessary dependencies)*
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook crop_prediction.ipynb
   ```

 Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).
3. Evaluate the model performance.
4. Use the trained model to predict suitable crops based on input parameters.

Model Performance
The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning models).
- Deploy the model as a web app or API.
- Integrate real-time weather data.
